## Description

- There can be unlimited calculations assuming the chain is going
- While loop will go until an "n" is entered
- A repeated calculation can use a previous number
- Made use of a dictionary to keep track of operators to use
## What I learnt

- Dictionaries ✅
- Functions ✅
- For and While loops ✅
- Built-in methods ✅
- How to keep an operation going forever ✅
- Debugging using StackOverflow and Google ✅
## How To Use

- Simply take two numbers, select an operation and the calculator will execute it in that order.
- There is no catch for errors, so the application might break if there are any misinputs
